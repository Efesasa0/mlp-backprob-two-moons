# Multi-Layer Perceptron for Moon Data Classification

- **Summary**: This project is part of EE456 at Penn State University. The main objective was to implement a multi-layer perceptron using MATLAB to classify two classes of moon-shaped data.

## File Descriptions

1. **`MLPBackProbv3.m`**: The MATLAB script containing the implementation of the multi-layer perceptron with backpropagation algorithm. It includes functions for forward and backward pass, weight updates, and training the network.

2. **`feedforwardApplication.m`**: A script used for applying the trained perceptron model to new data, demonstrating the model's ability to classify unseen moon data.

3. **`tanhD.m`**: A MATLAB function that computes the derivative of the hyperbolic tangent function, used in the backpropagation step of the neural network.

4. **`DataSet1_MP1.mat`** and **`DataSet2_MP1.mat`**: These files contain the moon-shaped data sets used for training and testing the perceptron model.

5. **`MiniProjectReport.pdf`**: A comprehensive report that details the project's goals, methodology, and findings. It includes a thorough explanation of the perceptron model, its architecture, and the results of classifying the moon data.

- **Project Insights**: The project successfully demonstrates the application of a multi-layer perceptron in classifying nonlinearly separable data. Key insights include the effectiveness of backpropagation in neural networks and the practical challenges in tuning and applying these models.

_This project highlights the use of neural networks, particularly multi-layer perceptrons, in solving complex classification problems, where I show the balance between theory and practical application in machine learning._
